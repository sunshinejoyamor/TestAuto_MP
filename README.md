# TestAuto_MP

Notes:
- For this exercise, I used Selenium for automation framework and Python for scripting
- Testing is done in 1920 x 1080 screen resolution with the browser opened on a maximised size. Any smaller screen resolution might cause for the script to fail as elements may not be found accordingly

Dependencies/Pre-requisites:
1. Selenium library - Reference: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_library/
2. Python - Reference: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Selenium WebDriver - For this exercise, I used Chrome driver - Reference: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
