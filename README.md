# TestAuto_MP

Notes:
- For this exercise, I used Selenium for automation framework and Python for scripting
- Testing is done in 2560,1440 screen size with the browser opened on a maximized size. Any smaller screen resolution might cause the script to fail as elements may not be found accordingly

1. Selenium library - Reference: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_library/
